Have you ever questioned when the ideal time of year is to reserve a hotel room? Alternatively, how long should I remain to get the greatest daily rate? What if you wanted to foretell whether a hotel would unreasonably frequently receive unusual requests? You can investigate those questions using the data from hotel reservations! This data collection comprises reservation details for a city hotel and a resort hotel, as well as details like the date the reservation was made, the duration of the stay, the number of adults, kids, and/or babies, and the number of parking spaces that are available. The data is devoid of any information that may be used to identify a specific person.

In this project I explored this dataset with a goal in my mind to find out hidden insights in the data that could help the hotels to grow their business. To perform the analysis I used python packages like pandas and for visualization used matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. Approach I followed is to make use visualization to find out underlying trends and patterns among the features, and with the help of my business acumen generated insights. Insights are in the conclusion section at bottom.

The analysis of hotel bookings using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data analysis techniques has proven to be invaluable in the hotel industry. Through EDA, we were able to gain insights into customer preferences, booking patterns, and seasonal trends, allowing hotels to optimize their operations and enhance customer experiences. By leveraging data analysis, hotels can identify underperforming areas and make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, revenue generation, and overall profitability. Furthermore, EDA enables hotels to understand customer behavior, leading to the development of targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings that cater to individual preferences. In a highly competitive industry, the use of EDA and data analysis empowers hotels to stay ahead by adapting to changing market dynamics and providing exceptional guest experiences. Ultimately, the integration of these techniques has the potential to revolutionize the hotel industry, enabling hoteliers to make informed decisions, maximize revenue, and deliver enhanced customer satisfaction.
